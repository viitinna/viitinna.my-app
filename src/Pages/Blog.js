                                In ancient times there was a known species of rose, called as petal (centifolia). From it comes the semi-terry Gallic, from which comes the Kazanlak, which is bred to produce oil. In the 18th century, there were eighteen varieties of roses, six of which were non-terry.
                                All the variety of rose varieties is created as a result of crossing old varieties with new species brought to Europe from other countries.
                                The progenitors of new varieties, including flowering more than once, but twice a summer and even continuously all summer were brought from India in 1789 Bengal roses, from China in 1810 - tea pink and in 1824 - yellow. Such roses are called remontant. At the end of the 19th century, there were 4,000 remontant varieties, of which several dozen still survive.
                                From 1875, curly multi-flowered (non-liana) roses appeared. Up to two hundred flowers bloom on one bush of such roses at once. Because of this, one of the varieties is named: "A Thousand Beauties".

                                Tulips were brought to Europe from Turkey, once introduced by humans, they have spread widely beyond their natural ranges. Various forms of tulips from northern Italy, France and Switzerland, previously recognized as separate species of the Neotulipae group, are descendants of Gesner's garden tulips. The introduced forest tulip is found almost everywhere in Western Europe, including Scotland, the Baltic States and the southern regions of the Scandinavian countries. The map of its populations in northern Germany coincides with the map of the lost landowners' estates and church gardens.
                                The type species of the genus, the Gesner tulip, has not been found in nature. All its wild-growing forms in Europe, Asia and North America  are feral descendants of cultivated plants; the species in the modern sense has absorbed many forms that in the past were considered independent wild-growing species [comm. one]. Modern botanists reject the assumption that its natural form may be the Schrenck tulip growing in the Black Sea region. In their view, the Gesner tulip is "a collective name given to a large number of garden and feral forms of unknown origin", "an extremely complex species that gave rise to most garden cultivars", and "a complex hybrid known only in culture and in feral forms - in France, Italy, Norway, Russia, Switzerland and Turkey ”.

                                Lily in the Bible
                                Lily is a biblical term (Hebrew שושנה in the Jewish Old Testament; Old Greek κρίνον - in the Greek Septuagint, Latin lilium - in the Latin Vulgate). The opinion that "שושנה" is a rose, as Luther conveys this word almost everywhere in the Bible, is incorrect, since this plant, in all likelihood, began to be cultivated in Palestine only in the Persian or even Greek period. However, there is not enough data in the Bible for a precise definition of the “שושנה” plant.
                                Especially often this name is found in the Song of Songs: a woman's breast (Song of Songs 4: 5) and lips (Song of 5:13) are compared with this plant, which indicates that there were flowers "שושנים" of white and red color. But according to Tristram, only the so-called red sarana (Latin Lilium chalcedonicum) grew in Palestine, and according to Boissier , only the white lily (Lilium candidum) is found there. Some researchers believed that "שושנה" meant a buttercup (Anemone coronaria), and according to Lagarde, "שושנה", like the Egyptian word, meant a lotus, and that this particular plant is meant when describing architectural decorations in a temple.

                                The beauty of the lilies was praised by Jesus Christ and placed above all the magnificent clothes of Solomon. The lilies of the field usually bloom in Galilee in April and May, the season of the year in which, it is believed, the Sermon on the Mount was delivered by Him, with mention, among other things, of the beauty of the lilies: “Look at the lilies of the field, how they grow: they do not labor, do not spin. But I tell you that Solomon, in all his glory, did not dress like any one of them ”(Matthew 6: 28-29). In addition to the beauty of the flower, their fragrant, pleasant smell is also mentioned in the Bible: “Blossom like a lily, spread incense and sing a song” (Sirach. 39:18).
